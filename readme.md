esmBot is an entertainment-focused Discord bot made using [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/) with soundboard, utility, and image manipulation commands.

## Usage
You can invite the bot to your server using this link: https://projectlounge.pw/invitedev

A command list can be found [here](https://projectlounge.pw/esmBot/help.html).

If you want to run it locally, you should install ImageMagick, FFmpeg, and MongoDB:

```shell
sudo apt-get install imagemagick ffmpeg mongodb
```

After that, you should install the rest of the dependencies using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, fill in the info inside `.env.example`, rename it to `.env`, and run `app.js`.

If you want to run this on Windows, I highly recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux. I personally used the [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6) distro for testing, however other distros might work as well.
